                <p class="columns-text">
                    St. John Bosco was an Italian Catholic priest, educator, and founder of the Salesian 
                    Society. He dedicated his life to helping disadvantaged youth, particularly in the city of Turin, Italy during 
                    the 19th century. Bosco's approach to education was based on kindness, empathy, and understanding, and he emphasized 
                    the importance of practical training and vocational skills for young people.

                    Throughout his life, Bosco faced many challenges and obstacles, including poverty, illness, and opposition from 
                    some members of the church. However, he remained steadfast in his commitment to his mission, and his work had a
                     profound impact on the lives of countless young people. Bosco's legacy continues to inspire people around the world 
                     today, and he is remembered as a model of selflessness, compassion, and dedication to the betterment of society.

                    <br>
                    Our summer camp is inspired by the work and teachings of St. John Bosco! Bosco's mission is to provide 
                    a fun and engaging experience for children, while also instilling the values of kindness, empathy, 
                    and practical skills that were central to St. John Bosco's philosophy. Our volunteers are committed to 
                    creating a safe and supportive environment that fosters growth and encourages children to be their 
                    best selves. We believe that every child has the potential to thrive, and we are committed to helping 
                    them achieve their goals.
