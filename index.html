                    St John Bosco is remembered as a man who spent his life helping poor and abandoned children and
                    teaching them about God.

                    He saw terrible poverty and hunger on the streets, where he worked as a priest, in Turin, a large
                    city in Italy. He wanted to help the poor children so that they could have a better life.

                    St John Bosco was very good at juggling and tight rope walking. He used to gather the children off
                    the streets and entertain them with the many tricks he could do.

                    Some other people saw the good work he was dong to help these children and they decided to help him
                    too. John Bosco and his helpers started to set up schools in Turin to help the poor children. They
                    also set up an order of priests in the Catholic Church called the Salesians. The order spread all
                    over the world.

                    The priests in this order still do wonderful work in helping young people to understand about God
                    and his work.
